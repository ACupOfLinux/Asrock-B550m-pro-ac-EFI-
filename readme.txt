!!!!!!!!!!!THIS IS ONLY FOR THIS SPECIFIC MOTHERBOARD!!!!!!!!!!!

You must be using my exact hardware to use this or there are bound to be error's and hardships, so unless you are on the EXACT same hardware as me do not use this.

I have recently updated this to the latest version of opencore and will continue to do so if you are using OSX-KVM with a full machine passthrough this should work for you also if you have the same hardware. 

This also works on the lastest version of MacOS ie. Ventura, I have yet to test or tinker this for MacOS Sonoma as it has not been fully released so if you try to use this efi for sonoma I will guarentee that this will not work.

My efi also has Radeon Patches so if you do not need those uncheck the kext's that follow and remove the boot arg adgpmod=pikera 

If you are using exact hardware the boot chime will work also.
